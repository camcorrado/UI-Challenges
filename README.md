# UI Challenges

A compilation of 20 UI challenges to help expand my knowledge of code and creativity.

## Motivation

These challenges were not only a great way to test my ability to create staple UI elements, but also provoked me to think outside of the box with how these classics could be implemented. I hope you have just as much fun exploring these challenges as I did coding them!
